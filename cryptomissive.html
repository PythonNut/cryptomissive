    Hello fellow programmer.

    If you came here thinking that my primitive terminology and simple UI
    indicate my lack of Crypto skills, you are in for a bit of a surprise.

    The message which you seek is encrypted with AES-512. The key is
    generated via 9000 rounds of SHA-512. I have done my homework. This
    pipeline is simple and bulletproof.

    In short, you will not be getting the plaintext from this ciphertext
    anytime soon. Not without the key, that is.

    Cheers!
    Jonathan
